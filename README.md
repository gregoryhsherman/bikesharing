# Bikesharing

### Overview

This project looked at the data from August 2019 for an NYC bikesharing company.  Inputting the data into tableau allowed us to look at a couple specific points and how the service was being utilized.

### Results

My results are included in the story on each slide.

### Summary

The main points we looked at for the challenge were the checkout times and the trip times.  In examining the checkout times, we saw that the peak times for checking out bikes were between 4 and 7 am.  This led me to believe that the service is a per-day rather than per-hour charge.  The number of checkouts continues to decline after 7 am all the way until 12 midnight, when there is a surge right at 12:01 and the number of checkouts starts to increase.

Another interesting piece of data is that there are over 3 times as many men checking out bikes than women.  That is a huge difference in numbers - I would have expected the numbers to show near equal, maybe a favoring the male demographic a little.

Another neat piece of data that we found was the number of trips on the rented bikes spiked during peak commuting hours during the week.  Not really shocking, but still neat confirmation.  Also, the number of men commuting on weekdays was, again, much higher than the number of women.  On the weekends, however, the time of bike trips were spread out throughout the daytime hours.  The number of non-subscriber rentals was a lot higher on the weekends than during the week, showing that a lot of visitors or non-workers were using them for leisure, rather than commuting.
